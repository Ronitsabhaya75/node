// This file documents that Date serialization in TAP reporter YAML output
// is tested via the fixture test: test/fixtures/test-runner/output/tap_date_serialization.js
// 
// The fixture test verifies that:
// 1. Date objects are serialized as clean ISO strings (e.g., "2023-01-01T12:00:00.000Z")
// 2. Date vs String comparisons show clear distinction (Date vs '2023-01-01T12:00:00.000Z')  
// 3. Nested Date objects in error details are properly serialized
// 4. Date objects do NOT include their methods/properties (getTime, valueOf, etc.)
//
// This behavioral testing approach is more robust than testing implementation details
// and is resistant to code refactoring.
